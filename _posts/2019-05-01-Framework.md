The file repository provides a set of Power BI files (pbx) and respective template files (pbit) that can be used to build your own marketing analytic reports.
The focus of the Power BI code framework is to provide ready built and easy to use data sources that connect to data from Dynamic 365 for Marketing including date filters and on liner query building in M-code to access specific profile and interaction tables. 

The framework provides ready build report parameters which present data entry dialogs to the data analyst who opens a marketing report template file in order to configure and publish marketing analytics in his organization.
